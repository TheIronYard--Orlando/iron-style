Open your Terminal to the directory you want to work in. (Ask for help with navigating around in the Terminal if you need it.) If your GitHub account is set up completely, you will be able to copy this project to your computer with the command

`hub clone TheIronYard--Orlando/iron-style`

Work with a partner to correct all of the mistakes in the HTML in the site. Once the HTML looks good, play with the site a little to get a feel for how the different style properties affect the site's appearance. Play with some style properties in Chrome Developer Tools. Some good ones to start with are `padding`, `border`, and `font-family`. You can add to the rules in `style.css`, or change the rules that are already in that file.

When you have the HTML working and the CSS to your taste, create a repository on GitHub called `iron-style`, [add it as a remote to your project](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/), and submit the link for the repo you created to complete the assignment.
